# BFR
Utilizing BFR algorithm, cluster a large amount of data
When there is a large amount of data and the memory is not able to keep all of them, we are supposed to load those data in
  multiple passes. In order to cluster them, K-means is not enough. Based on K-means++, BFR algorithm is preferreable to deal
  with this problem.
